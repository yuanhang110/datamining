This book describes how to write an executable book using the Docker image for the CityU course CS5483 Data Warehousing and Data Mining. The book is compiled from a set of Jupyter Notebooks that can be executed 
- locally with VSCode DevContainer and 
- remotely with Binder and JupyterHub services.

The contents are 
- version controlled with Git and 
- published as a website hosted by GitLab pages updated continuously with CD/CI.

The contents are also structured in the format a research report so that the repository may be used as a template for group projects.
